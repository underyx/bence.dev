            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I'd be
                <span itemprop="name">
                    <span itemprop="givenName">Bence</span>
                    <span itemprop="familyName">Nagy</span>
                </span>
                &ndash; and oh my, what a great question! A software engineer
                who'd love to think he's good at design, too. I quit high school
                halfway through my senior year (back in 2013) to go work as an
                engineer at <a href="https://allmyles.com/">Allmyles</a>, while
                I got my high school diploma on my own. My responsibilities at
                Allmyles crept up on me so much that I became the technical lead
                there. In August 2015, I relocated to the Czech Republic to go
                work on <a href="https://www.kiwi.com">Kiwi.com</a>'s
                backend. I mainly use Python, but I'm always eager to experiment
                with the latest craze amongst hackers.

            <h2>Who am I, really?</h2>
            <p>
                An avid gamer, for the most part, under the alias
                '<span itemprop="additionalName">underyx</span>'. Most of the
                time I play Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Team
                Fortress 2 &mdash; all of which I'm horrible at, even after
                thousands of hours spent on them over the years (and weirdly
                enough, that didn't stop me from dabbling in playing
                competitively for a bit over a year). When I'm not busy with
                those games, I love checking out the latest indie/artsy games
                out there; I'm a huge advocate for both games being viewed as a
                form of art, and competitive gaming being viewed as a sport.
