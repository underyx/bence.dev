      Yeah, hello there! Introductions are difficult,
      soâ€¦ let&rsquo;s hop right in :D
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m Bence Nagy.
      I usually go by &lsquo;underyx&rsquo; online.
      I currently travel the world as a digital nomad,
      as the CEO of <OutboundLink href="https://under.ee">Under</OutboundLink>.{' '}
      I&rsquo;m available as a Developer Experience &amp; Culture consultant for your business
      &mdash; to help your engineers create <em>better software, faster</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I keep getting lost in trying new things. But a couple interests that have
      stayed with me for a longer time are rationality, video games, and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, I have a request for you, dear reader: please contact me with
      whatever problem you&rsquo;re facing right now. Even if you think I cannot
      help with it. The harder, the better. Seriously, I love difficult problems.
      Thank you!
