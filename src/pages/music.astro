  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>
    Just you wait, I&rsquo;ll make some super fancy page to show off my
    playlists here. I&rsquo;ve been putting them together regularly ever since
    2013, and, well, I&rsquo;m pretty proud of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Until then I have to ask you to just check them out on{" "}
    <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/underyx"> my Spotify profile</a>{" "}
     the old, boring way.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if you were expecting me to produce music myself, welp, sorry to
    disappoint you. Not there yet. I bought a used OP-1 in 2023 and had it
    stolen from me less than two weeks later. Thanks SF.
