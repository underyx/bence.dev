    "description": "On the cutting edge of technology, engineers have this new mania about this so-called \"Chaos Engineering\" — which is essentially ops people willfully breaking their own infrastructure. Crazy, right? Why would anyone do this? Just to show off? To fight off boredom? Is it just some manifestation of masochist tendencies? Well, it's actually none of the above, so I'll try to explain the whys and hows of this fascinating concept in my talk.",

Five minutes later you see a Slack notification, someone is deploying one of your commits from last week. You start playing an episode of My Little Pony, cause no one really bothers you, except for one guy replying with \"Cool.\"  We at Kiwi.com have situations like this, too! Come and check my presentation on how we were able to get the mess around production releases into order, making them stable, predictable, trackable, and in general… just an uneventful fact of life.",

To end on a positive note, I'll also introduce how we managed to phish-proof our employees, so that we could cross this one out from our list of worries.",

Better yet, turns out we’re doing a fairly nice job at building them! What could be better then, than to come tell the world about all we learned so far?  I’ll talk about how you can identify what tools you can create, which ones you should actually create, and how to actually design that app so that it elegantly solves your problem and gets adopted by your team.",
